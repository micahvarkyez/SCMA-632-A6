Clean the data, check for outliers and missing values, interpolate the data if there are any missing values, and plot a line graph of the data neatly named. Create a test and train data set
out of this data.

Convert the data to monthly and decompose time series into the components using additive and multiplicative models. 

1. Univariate Forecasting - Conventional Models/Statistical Models
− Fit a Holt Winters model to the data and forecast for the next year. 
− Fit an ARIMA model to the daily data and do a diagnostic check validity of the model. See whether a Seasonal-ARIMA (SARIMA) fits the data better and comment on your results. Forecast the series for the next three months. 
− Fit the ARIMA to the monthly series.

2. Multivariate Forecasting - Machine Learning Models
− NN (Neural Networks) -Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)
− Tree based models - Random Forest, Decision Tree
